HOW TO ADD A NEW BLOG POST
=========================

This is the simplest possible blog system - just HTML files!

TO ADD A NEW POST:

1. Copy the template:
   cp public/blog/template.html public/blog/your-post-name.html

2. Edit the new file:
   - Update the <title> tag
   - Update the <meta name="description"> tag
   - Change the h1 title
   - Add the date
   - Write your content in HTML

3. Update the blog index (public/blog/index.html):
   - Copy one of the existing blog entry blocks
   - Update the link, title, date, and excerpt
   - Add it at the top of the list

4. Update homepage (public/index.html):
   - Add your post to the blog-grid section
   - Remove the oldest post if you want to show only 3

5. Update navigation in your post:
   - Edit the "Previous" and "Next" links at the bottom
   - Update the previous post to link to yours as "Next"

6. Deploy:
   wrangler deploy

THAT'S IT!

No build process, no dependencies, just HTML files.

TIPS:
- Keep post filenames simple: "my-post-title.html"
- Use the same CSS styles as the template
- Test locally by opening the HTML files in your browser
- The blog will be as fast as possible - it's just HTML!
